# APL lunch discussion with other phd-students

We talked about novel aspects in WCP

## Anti-gaming / fraud-detection

* Method for include challenges in jobs (ideally in a way that can not be detected)
* Simple approach is to verify a task on server with certain probability

## Gamification

* Create game where solving task gives points in game economy

## Other stuff

We probably talked about other stuff, but can't remember it now
