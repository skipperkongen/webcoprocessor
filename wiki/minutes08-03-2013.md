We talked about novel aspects in WCP together with:

* Niels Bj√∏rn

## Anti-gaming / fraud-detection

* Method for include challenges in jobs (ideally in a way that can not be detected)
* Simple approach is to verify a task on server with certain probability

## Gamification

* Create game where solving task gives points in game economy

## Rerouting

* If a server is full, send instruction to browser to reconnect on other socket

## Local storage 

* [filldisk.com](http://filldisk.com) is a fun page that uses HTML5 local storage to fill users HD with cat images
* Think "volatile storage" together with "volatile computation"
