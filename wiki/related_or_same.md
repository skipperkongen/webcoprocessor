# Related or identical codes

The idea ("web co-processor") is not as virgin as I first assumed. After Googling a bit, I've found references to codes online that look very similar to mine, i.e. running jobs in client browsers, for instance mapreduce jobs. The most prominent suggestion is [Collaborative Map-Reduce in the Browser](http://www.igvita.com/2009/03/03/collaborative-map-reduce-in-the-browser/) by [Ilya Grigorik](http://www.igvita.com/) who works at Google.

The original suggestion generated a lot of comments from the community. The [comments on slashdot](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/09/03/03/1910207/collaborative-map-reduce-in-the-browser) and the [comments in a follow-up post](http://www.igvita.com/2009/03/07/collaborative-swarm-computing-notes/) look great. In light of how many useful comments where generated in a short amount of time, Ilya made the following observation:

> Observing this pattern made me wonder about the future of science, and how radically different it is from the current ivory tower approach of life-long research tracks, specialized conferences, and tight knit groups.

I couldn't agree more!

More recently (2011) the exact same idea seems to have been proposed on Hacker News: [Map-Reduce in JavaScript, working on client Browsers](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1930681).
